# EMG Loop — Project Status (where we left off)

The living "current state" per workstream, so any session (or Matt) can resume without
losing the thread. **One current-state block per workstream — overwrite it, don't append.**
Read this at the start of a session; update it at the end of a work batch. History lives
in git, not here.

_Last updated: 2026-07-22._

## How to read this
Each workstream is either **DONE (merged)**, **IN REVIEW (open PR)**, or **NOT BUILT**.
"NOT BUILT" surfaces show honest "Not Configured / unavailable" states — never fake data.

## ⚠️ Cannot be validated in the dev environment
There is **no database, no runtime, and no email** in the dev sandbox, so anything below
marked _(needs deploy validation)_ is verified only by typecheck + build + unit tests —
NOT by seeing it render or run. Those must be checked on the deploy.

---

## Dashboard — DONE (merged: #128/#129)
`/app/admin` is the one-screen 9-tile command center. Honest tiles only
(Verified / Derived / Unknown / Unavailable). CallGrid **scorecard**: Yesterday (Completed)
vs Today (Live) × Revenue / Profit / Billable / Total, with per-metric % trend. Business
Status = system connectivity, never invented health. Eastern-time day boundaries.
_(needs deploy validation: one-screen fit + real values.)_

## CallGrid Intelligence & Brain — DONE (merged: #136)
**Ownership split — every component has exactly one owner.** `/app/admin/brain` is now the
real **Brain** page and owns the entire Executive Brain (Executive Summary, System Health,
Cross-Sensor Insights, What Changed, Top Risks/Opportunities, Recommended Actions, Evidence
Coverage/Sources, Confidence) + the Evidence/Platform-Health rail + Live Calls — moved
verbatim. **CallGrid Intelligence** (`/app/admin/marketplace`) was rebuilt to EXACTLY five
tile sections: Today, Yesterday (Revenue/Profit/Billable/Total via `marketplaceCalls.aggregateWindow`
+ shared `toScore` truth-states), Top Performers (`loadDimensionWindows`), Watch List
(`report.risks` only — never a false all-clear), Quick Access (6 navigate-only tiles). Six
drill-downs unchanged (Buyers/Vendors/Sources/Campaigns/Activity/**Bids**). Brain is now a
sidebar item (icon `brain`); CallGrid uses `chart`.
**Follow-up:** the Bids page (`/marketplace/auction`) is still a raw-table surface — needs a
real drill-down pass. _(needs deploy validation: real values + reconciliation.)_

## CallGrid Intelligence finalization — IN PROGRESS · branch `feat/callgrid-intelligence-finalization`
An 18-phase controlled reorg/correction of `/app/admin/marketplace` (not a redesign). **Audit done;
canonical source proven:** `crmRepos.marketplaceCalls.aggregateWindow(org, since, until)` →
`{calls, monetized(=billable), revenueCents, payoutCents, costCents, callsWithRevenue, buyers[],
vendors[], sources[], campaigns[]}` is THE CallGrid economics source (Overview uses it via
`loadDimensionWindows` + `toScore`). It already takes arbitrary date windows.
- **Increment 1 (#143, draft):** fixed the **Buyers contradiction** — Buyers read
  `revenueIntelligence.revenueByDimension` (CRM/revenue; returned UNKNOWN → false 0) while Overview
  read the call projection. Buyers now reads the **same canonical source**; rebuilt to the spec
  (6 summary tiles, sortable performance table w/ share+trend, `?buyer=` detail, honest states);
  **all cross-product content stripped** (Integration Status, Live Calls rail, Brain briefing,
  provider pills, decision queue). Also retired the paid-off Buyers zero-coercion ledger entry.
- **Increment 2 (#144, draft — stacked on #143):** the reporting **foundation**. Shared
  **date-window contract** in `@emgloop/shared` (`resolveCallGridWindow` — all presets +
  comparison periods, Eastern, 13 tests); canonical **`callgrid-report`** service (window →
  metrics + dimension rows over `aggregateWindow`, Truth-honest); **date-range picker**
  (`CallGridDateRange`, URL-driven, persists across tabs via range-aware nav). **Overview + Buyers
  wired** onto it (same window → consistent). shared 106/106, build clean.
- **Remaining (own PRs, Phase-18 order):** (3) Watch List → CallGrid-operational-only (drop
  active-users finding); (4) Vendors + Campaigns on an extracted shared dimension template adopting
  the control; (5) Sources (bid grain) + **Bids** rebuild (source vs destination separation) +
  `auction → bids` route; (6) Activity stream; (7) move engineering diagnostics →
  `Administration → Diagnostics → CallGrid`; final tests + responsive.
- ℹ️ Picker custom range uses native date inputs (functional, Eastern-correct); two-month visual
  calendar is later polish.
- ⚠️ Current Bids route is `/marketplace/auction`; spec canonical is `/marketplace/bids` (rename in 5).

## Work OS — DONE (merged #130, CSS #132); Start Work + Work Types (#135)
Dashboard-matched one-screen tile grid, business terminology, **Team Work** page, centralized
route→product resolver. **Start Work rebuilt (#135)** as a centered sectioned form; **Work
Types = Blueprint** (adapted, no new table — deploy runs only `prisma generate`), config in
`Blueprint.metadata`; starter catalog + admin at `/app/admin/administration/work-types`.
_(needs deploy validation: real work data.)_

## Configurable sequential workflows — ENGINE DONE (merged #137); Start Work UI IN REVIEW (#138)
Backend engine built on existing tables (Work Type = Blueprint `kind='work_type'`, Workflow
Template = Blueprint `kind='workflow_template'` + stages, Work Item = WorkInstance, Work Step
= WorkStage — all per-step config in `metadata`). **Engine merged (#137):** 5 assignment modes
(specific / responsibility / creator / previous-completer / unassigned) with fail-closed
resolution; sequential handoff (only step 1 active → complete → resolve+activate exactly the
next → final completes item + notifies all participants); workflow-template save /
list-by-work-type / reuse / duplicate / activate; custom-field defs; member **de-dup + email
normalization** source fix.
**Start Work UI (#138, draft):** the six-section builder — Select Work Type (+ inline Add-New-Type
modal) · Work Info + type-specific custom fields · Select/Build workflow (saved template / build /
single-person; save-as-template) · vertical step-assignment review · Priority + optional Eastern
target · Review & Start. Drives `createWorkItem`. Removed the redundant globals (Related-To
selector, free-text Reference, Responsibility dropdown, Assign-To radio + Team Member, flat
Requirements). Engine gained `WorkTypeView.fields` + a workflow-aware `buildWorkItemSubmission`
(replaces the single-owner `buildWorkSubmission`). Typecheck+build clean, DB suite 150/150.
- ⚠️ **`ResponsibilityAssignment` model does NOT exist** (spec assumed it) — responsibility
  resolves via a configurable org owner-map; absent ⇒ Needs an Owner (never fabricated).
- ⚠️ **Duplicate "Matt Dunn" is DATA, not a query bug**: the demo-seed OWNER `admin@emgloop.com`
  got renamed to "Matt Dunn" during setup and coexists with Matt's real account. Dedup collapses
  same-id/same-email; the two distinct-email rows need the seed `admin@`/`manager@`/`viewer@`
  rows **removed once via the Team page** (persists since #134).
- **NOT built yet:** the Work Detail timeline + Complete-My-Step (increment 2), the Workflow
  Template admin page (increment 3), and the custom-field **config** UI (defs render when present;
  no Type defines any until the config UI ships).

## Onboarding / invitations / team lifecycle — DONE (merged: #129, #133, #134)
Absolute invite/reset URLs; team management at `/app/admin/administration/team`. **Lifecycle
hardened (#133):** invite/re-invite go through `prepareInvitation` (no more P2002 Team-page
crash; reinstates the one `(org,email)` row); login gates on ACTIVE. **Fake-member seed fixed
(#134):** demo identities (Morgan/Riley/etc.) only seed when `isDemoSeedEnabled` (explicit flag
+ non-production); a seed can never reactivate a removed member. Pre-existing seed rows still
need one-time removal via the Team page. _(needs deploy validation: fresh-invitation journey.)_

## Business timezone — DONE (merged)
`BUSINESS_TIME_ZONE = 'America/New_York'` in `@emgloop/shared` (DST-aware via Intl). Every
calendar-day boundary (today/yesterday/completed-today) is Eastern. Rolling N-day windows
stay duration-based (timezone-independent).

## Global sidebar — DONE (merged)
Flat: Dashboard · **Brain** · CallGrid Intelligence · CRM · Creator Hub · Work OS · Accounting ·
Administration (footer: Team · Work Types, permission-aware). One shared shell; longest-prefix
active-state.

## CRM · Creator Hub · Accounting — NOT BUILT
Approved operating areas, shown in the sidebar, but not built/connected. They render honest
"Not Configured / unavailable" states and **never** show fabricated data. (CRM specifically
must never surface CallGrid caller records as contacts — the `Customer` table is shared.)

## Open threads / next steps
1. **Configurable workflows — engine merged (#137); Start Work builder in review (#138).** Next
   UI increments on a fresh branch off main: (2) Work Detail timeline + Complete-My-Step
   (handoff/complete), then (3) Workflow Template admin page + custom-field config UI.
2. **Data repair (Team page, one-time):** remove the demo-seed rows `admin@emgloop.com`
   (renamed "Matt Dunn"), `manager@emgloop.com` (Morgan), `viewer@emgloop.com` (Riley) so
   assignee/member lists show real people only. Recreation is already gated (#134).
3. **Deploy validation** (only on the deploy): Dashboard/Work OS fit; fresh-invitation journey;
   CallGrid scorecard reconciliation; Brain page renders the moved Executive Brain.
4. **Platform floor** (CLAUDE.md Long-Term Goals): commit the lockfile; a CI gate on `main`; a
   **web test harness** (route/render/permission tests can't run without one today).
5. **CallGrid polish:** Bids raw-table page → real drill-down; per-drill-down copy.

## Working agreement
**One branch per work batch.** After a PR merges, cut a fresh branch off freshly-merged
`main` for the next objective — never keep committing to a merged branch (it strands work
with no open PR). Always open a draft PR and report its URL; Matt merges.
